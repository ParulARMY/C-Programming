# C Programming

**Description of Tutorials**<br>

Welcome to the [C Programming Tutorials from NESO Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0g4ty29Xgg&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRh6isJ01MBnbNpV3ZsktSyS) It is freely available on you-tube. The instructor has done a great job , he breaks down the complex topics into small chunks and thoroughly explained n an easy-to-understand manner. 
 Even if you have zero programming experience, these tutorials will take you from beginner to professional level and will help you to build up logical understanding. The great thing about these tutorials are the instructor has include questions which had been asked in GATE paper.

<b>Lecture 1:</b> Features & The First C program
1. Protability.
2. Procedural language
3. Middle Level language
4. Popular  choice for system apps
5. Wide variety of built in function, standard libraries and header files.<br>

  <b>*Defines*</b>
   - <b>Comments</b>: compilers usually ignore the comments. They are for programmers to make the code more readable.
   - <b>#include</b>: #include is a preprocessor which replace the text with actual content.
   - <b>stdio.h</b>:It is a standard input and output file with .h extension. It is header file. Header contain the prototype of the           functions like printf and scanf.
   - <b>main </b>: It is the starting point of the function.int main means after the completation of function it will return interger. for example `return 0` means after correct execution of function it will return 0 and if something went wrong it will return garbade value.

<b>Lecture 2:</b> Introduction to Variable
 variables are names that points to some memory location. A variable should always declare before using it. memory location depends upon the type you use.<br>
      - int : 2 bytes or 4 bytes depending upon the compiler.<br>
      - char :1 byte<br>
Each variable must be define only once but it can be use multiple time.<br>
